# WLBT Tour Reservation APP

WLBT tour Reservation app is designed to collect basic reservation information to different tourist destinations from vacationers and vacation plans can be prebooked ahead of high-season. This app lets users choose their destination, hotel facility, airport pickup and dropoff, passenger gender, duration of stay, passenger size.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Collect user personal information with a form
- Collect travellers destination of choice information
- See a summary of their selections on the final step
- Confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
- Forward the information collect for processing
